## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.com/)
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (latest stable)
- [Tauri CLI](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/daschinmoy21/Kortex.git
   cd kortex
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. Run in development mode:
   ```bash
   bun run tauri dev
   ```

4. Build for production:
   ```bash
   bun tauri build
   ```

   For linux, there is a known issue with linuxdeploy in tauri and hence build throws a error and doesnt create a proper appimage. 
   Use ```bash 
   NO_STRIP=true bun tauri build```

### NixOS / Nix Installation

Kortex is available as a Nix flake for easy installation on NixOS or any system with Nix.

**Run without installing:**
```bash
nix run github:daschinmoy21/Kortex
```

**Install to user profile:**
```bash
nix profile install github:daschinmoy21/Kortex
```

**Add to NixOS configuration:**

1. Add to your flake inputs:
   ```nix
   inputs.kortex = {
     url = "github:daschinmoy21/Kortex";
     inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
   };
   ```

2. Pass it through `specialArgs` and use in your config:
   ```nix
   environment.systemPackages = [
     kortex.packages.${pkgs.system}.default
   ];
   ```

**Development shell:**
```bash
nix develop  # Enters a shell with all dependencies
bun install
bun tauri dev
```

## Usage

- **Creating Notes**: Use the file tree sidebar to create new notes or organize existing ones
- **AI Assistance**: Access AI features through the AI sidebar for content generation and editing
- **Drawing**: Click the drawing tool to open TLDRAW for visual notes
- **Recording**: Use the recording feature to capture audio and automatically transcribe it
- **Search**: Press `Alt+P` or `Meta/Cmd+P`(for Mac) to open the command palette and search across all content

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your API keys:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key
GOOGLE_GENRATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your_google_key
```

## Development

### Project Structure

- `src/` - React frontend application
- `src-tauri/` - Tauri backend and Rust code
- `src/components/` - Reusable UI components
- `src/store/` - State management with Zustand

### Available Scripts

- `bun run dev` - Start the Vite development server
- `bun run build` - Build the frontend for production
- `bun run tauri dev` - Start Tauri development mode
- `bun run tauri build` - Build the native application

### Updating Frontend for Nix Builds

The `dist/` folder is committed to the repository for reproducible Nix builds. When you make frontend changes, you must rebuild and commit the dist folder:

```bash
# Enter dev shell (if on NixOS)
nix develop

# Make your frontend changes...

# Rebuild the frontend
bun run build

# Commit the updated dist
git add dist/
git commit -m "Update frontend build"
git push
```

> **Note**: This is required because Nix builds are sandboxed and cannot access the network to run `bun install`. Pre-building ensures reproducible builds for all users.

## Packaging and Dependencies (Windows)

When distributing the Windows installer, include this checklist so users have the required runtime components for audio capture and transcription to work.

Required on target machine (or bundled in installer):

- Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable (Visual Studio C++ 2015-2022 runtime)
- FFmpeg available on PATH (required by some audio libs and optional features)
- Python 3.12+ (if not bundling a portable Python)
  - pip available
  - If your installer does not bundle Python, the app will attempt to create a virtual environment and install dependencies at first run.
- Internet access for pip installs (unless you bundle prebuilt wheels)

Optional but recommended:

- Code-sign the EXE/MSI to avoid SmartScreen/AV false positives

Packaging tips:

- You can bundle a portable Python and a pre-created venv inside your installer to avoid first-run installs (tradeoff: larger installer size).
- Run installer tests on a clean Windows VM to reproduce missing-dependency issues.

## Using the preflight check

The app exposes a Tauri command `prereflight_check` that returns JSON with diagnostics (python presence, ffmpeg, VC++ runtime, network, resource paths). The UI can call this command at first run to show actionable errors to users.
