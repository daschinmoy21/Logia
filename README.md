> A powerful, AI-enhanced notes application built with Tauri and React, designed for technical content creators and knowledge workers.

Logia blends structured text editing with infinite visual canvases, ensuring your ideas are captured exactly how you envision them. With local-first performance and optional cloud capabilities, it is the perfect companion for your second brain.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Assistance**: Chat with your notes and edit them with AI using the provider you prefer — Google Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, OpenRouter, Groq, DeepSeek, Mistral, local models (Ollama, LM Studio, any OpenAI-compatible server), or the coding-agent CLIs you already have installed (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini CLI).
- **Vim Mode**: Optional modal editing in notes (motions, operators, text objects, visual mode, search, registers) plus keyboard navigation for the whole app — a leader key, a `:` command line and a file explorer.
- **Auto-hide Sidebar**: Pin the sidebar, or let it slide in when the pointer reaches the left edge (`Ctrl/⌘+\` to toggle).
- **Rich Text Editing**: Full-featured editor with BlockNote for structured content creation.
- **Visual Note-Taking**: Integrated **tldraw** canvas for infinite sketching, diagrams, and whiteboarding.
- **Audio Recording & Transcription**: Record and transcribe audio content directly in your notes.
- **File Management**: Hierarchical file tree with drag-and-drop organization.
- **Trash & Recovery**: Safely delete notes and folders with a 14-day recovery window.
- **Git Sync**: Optional git-based synchronization — connect any git remote to backup and sync your notes.
- **Search & Discovery**: Fast, fuzzy search across all your notes.
- **Kanban Boards**: Organize your tasks and workflows with visual boards.
- **Cross-Platform**: Native desktop app for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Markdown Support**: Full markdown rendering with GitHub Flavored Markdown.

## AI providers

Open **Settings → AI providers**, pick a provider, add its API key (stored encrypted in your OS keychain) and choose a model. You can switch providers any time from the picker above the AI chat box, or with `:provider <id>` in vim mode.

| Kind | Providers | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud APIs | Google Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, Groq, DeepSeek, Mistral | Need an API key |
| Local | Ollama, LM Studio, custom OpenAI-compatible URL | No key needed; runs offline |
| CLI agents | Claude Code (`claude`), Codex (`codex`), OpenCode (`opencode`), Gemini CLI (`gemini`) | Uses your existing CLI login/subscription. Logia runs them non-interactively in a scratch folder (Codex in its read-only sandbox) |

CLI agents power chat and transcript structuring; the inline `/ai` editor menu needs an HTTP provider.

## Vim mode

Turn it on in **Settings → Editor & Vim** or with the `VIM` badge in the header. The badge then shows the current mode; click it for the full cheat sheet.

- **Editor:** `hjkl`, `w b e`, `0 ^ $`, `gg G`, `f t ; ,`, `x r ~ J`, `d c y` + motion / text object (`dw`, `ciw`, `di"`), `dd yy cc p P`, `v V`, `>> <<`, `u` / `Ctrl-r`, `/ ? n N *`, counts.
- **Leader (`Space`):** `e` explorer, `f` find note, `a` AI chat, `n` new note, `c` new canvas, `b` pin/auto-hide sidebar, `t` to-do board, `h` home, `s` settings.
- **Explorer:** `j k` move, `l`/`Enter` open or expand, `h` collapse, `a`/`A` new note/folder, `r` rename, `d` delete, `s` star, `Esc` back to the editor.
- **Command line:** `:w`, `:q`, `:wq`, `:e <note>`, `:new`, `:canvas`, `:ai <prompt>`, `:provider <id>`, `:set novim`, `:help`.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.com/)
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (latest stable)
- [Tauri CLI](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/daschinmoy21/Logia.git
   cd logia
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. Run in development mode:

   ```bash
   bun run tauri dev
   ```

4. Build for production:

   ```bash
   bun tauri build
   ```

   > **Note for Linux Users**: There is a known issue with linuxdeploy in Tauri which may cause build errors with AppImage creation. usage:
>
   > ```bash
   > NO_STRIP=true bun tauri build
   > ```

### NixOS / Nix Installation

Logia is available as a Nix flake for easy installation on NixOS or any system with Nix.

**Run without installing:**

```bash
nix run github:daschinmoy21/Logia
```

**Install to user profile:**

```bash
nix profile install github:daschinmoy21/Logia
```

**Add to NixOS configuration:**

1. Add to your flake inputs:

   ```nix
   inputs.logia = {
     url = "github:daschinmoy21/Logia";
     inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
   };
   ```

2. Pass it through `specialArgs` and use in your config:

   ```nix
   environment.systemPackages = [
     logia.packages.${pkgs.system}.default
   ];
   ```

#### Git Sync

Logia uses git for note synchronization. To enable sync:

1. Create a private git repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
2. Open Logia Settings → Git Sync
3. Enter your remote URL (e.g., `git@github.com:user/logia-notes.git`) and branch name
4. Click **Connect Remote**
5. Use **Sync Now** to push/pull changes

**Authentication**: Logia uses your system's git credentials — SSH keys, `gh auth`, or git credential helper. No cloud OAuth tokens are stored.

**Development shell:**

```bash
nix develop  # Enters a shell with all dependencies
bun install
bun tauri dev
```

## Usage

- **Creating Notes**: Use the file tree sidebar to create new notes or organize existing ones.
- **AI Assistance**: Access AI features through the AI sidebar for content generation and editing.
- **Drawing**: Click the drawing tool to open the infinite canvas for visual notes.
- **Recording**: Use the recording feature to capture audio and automatically transcribe it.
- **Search**: Press `Alt+P` or `Meta/Cmd+P` (Mac) to open the command palette and search across all content.
- **Sync**: Configure a git remote in Settings and use Sync Now to push/pull your notes.

## Configuration

### Google AI API Key

Logia uses Google Generative AI for intelligent note generation and editing. To enable AI features:

1. Get an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
2. Open Logia and go to **Settings**
3. Enter your API key under the **Google AI** section
4. The key is stored securely via the system keyring / encrypted config — no `.env` files needed

> **Note**: Logia no longer requires Google OAuth. Only an API key is needed.

### Security / AI Keys

Logia uses a **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)** model. The API key is stored in the OS keyring (Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service) with an encrypted config file fallback — managed entirely in Rust. The key only enters the webview process when an AI feature is actively used (chat, slash-menu generation, or transcription structuring). Treat the machine as trusted; a full request-proxy through the Rust backend is a future hardening step.

### Git Sync

1. Create a **private** git repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
2. Open Logia → **Settings** → **Git Sync**
3. Paste your remote URL (e.g., `git@github.com:user/logia-notes.git`) and branch name
4. Click **Connect Remote**, then use **Sync Now** to push/pull changes

**Authentication**: Logia uses your system's git credentials — SSH keys, `gh auth`, or git credential helper. No OAuth tokens are stored.

### Optional Dependencies

- **git** — required for Git Sync
- **Python 3.12+** and **FFmpeg** — required for audio transcription (the preflight check surfaces missing dependencies on first run)

## Development

### Project Structure

- `src/` - React frontend application
- `src-tauri/` - Tauri backend and Rust code
- `src/components/` - Reusable UI components
- `src/store/` - State management with Zustand

### Available Scripts

- `bun run dev` - Start the Vite development server
- `bun run build` - Build the frontend for production
- `bun run tauri dev` - Start Tauri development mode
- `bun run tauri build` - Build the native application

### Updating Frontend for Nix Builds

The `dist/` folder is committed to the repository for reproducible Nix builds. When you make frontend changes, you must rebuild and commit the dist folder:

```bash
# Enter dev shell (if on NixOS)
nix develop

# Make your frontend changes...

# Rebuild the frontend
bun run build

# Commit the updated dist
git add dist/
git commit -m "Update frontend build"
git push
```

> **Note**: This is required because Nix builds are sandboxed and cannot access the network to run `bun install`. Pre-building ensures reproducible builds for all users.

## Packaging and Dependencies (Windows)

When distributing the Windows installer, include this checklist so users have the required runtime components for audio capture and transcription to work.

Required on target machine (or bundled in installer):

- Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable (Visual Studio C++ 2015-2022 runtime)
- FFmpeg available on PATH (required by some audio libs and optional features)
- Python 3.12+ (if not bundling a portable Python)
  - pip available
  - If your installer does not bundle Python, the app will attempt to create a virtual environment and install dependencies at first run.
- Internet access for pip installs (unless you bundle prebuilt wheels)

Optional but recommended:

- Code-sign the EXE/MSI to avoid SmartScreen/AV false positives

Packaging tips:

- You can bundle a portable Python and a pre-created venv inside your installer to avoid first-run installs (tradeoff: larger installer size).
- Run installer tests on a clean Windows VM to reproduce missing-dependency issues.

## Using the preflight check

The app exposes a Tauri command `prereflight_check` that returns JSON with diagnostics (python presence, ffmpeg, VC++ runtime, network, resource paths). The UI can call this command at first run to show actionable errors to users.
